		Keywords:
			+ Inheritance
			+ Polymorphism

		This project includes very simple examples involving polymorphism.
			
		PolymorhphismDemo:
			Demonstrates polymorphism in action. A simple inheritance hierarchy is
			created involving two classes. Upcasting is used on the definition and
			it is seen that the runtime type is used when invoking a method that is
			defined on both the superclass and subclass.
			It is also shown that when the method is not defined on the actual type,
			the one that is closer to it in the inheritance hierarchy is the one that 
			is called.
