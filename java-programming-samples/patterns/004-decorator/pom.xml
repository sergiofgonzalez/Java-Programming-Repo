		Design Pattern:
			Decorator:
				The Decorator pattern attaches additional responsibilities to an object
				dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing
				for extending functionality.
				
				A little more elaboration:
				+ Decorators have the same supertype as the objects they decorate.
				+ You can use one or more decorators to wrap an object.
				+ The decorator can be used in place of the original (wrapped) object.
				+ The decorator adds its own behavior either before and/or after
				delegating to the object it decorates to do the rest of the job.
				+ Objects can be decorated at any time, even at runtime. 
				
				Typically, you will have an abstract class playing the role of a
				Component and a set of existing classes that extend from it.
				Then, you will define a Decorator which also extends from the Component
				and that has to be implemented by concrete decorators.
			
		Design Principles:
			+ Open-Closed Principle: classes should be open for extension, but closed
			for modification.
			This means that classes should provide extension points so new behavior
			can be easily added; but the existing code of the class should not be
			open to modifications.
			This principle creates more resilient classes that are flexible enough to
			take on new functionality to meet changing requirements.

			+ Favor composition over inheritance.
			
		StarbuzzCoffeeDecoratorTest:
			This JUnit serves as the runner for the objects that demonstrates how to 
			apply the Decorator design pattern.
			
			The application solves the problem of a coffee-shop in which many types of
			coffees and condiments are available for purchase.
			Typically, a client selects a type of coffee (Espresso, House Blend, ...)
			and then one or more condiments such as a Milk, Soy, Mocha, etc.
			
			The application is structured with a simple Beverage base class and a set
			of subclasses that extend Beverage to represent the types of coffees. Then,
			a CondimentDecorator is defined, which also extends from Beverage, and a
			set of concrete classes that extend from CondimentDecorator and that 
			represent the condiments. These actual condiments provide a constructor
			that takes a Beverage so that they can decorate coffees and other 
			condiments to represent double-lattes and things like that. 

			The JUnit demonstrates how to create complicated coffees.
