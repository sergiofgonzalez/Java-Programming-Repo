		Keywords:
			+ Static Nested Classes

		This project includes a couple of very simple examples involving static nested classes:
	
		StaticNestedTestRunner:
			Demonstrates how an static nested class can access private static members of the outer class,
			and how an static class can be instantiated without instantiating its enclosing class.
			
		StaticNestedTestRunner:
			Demonstrates how an static nested class can define a member whose name clashes with
			a member name of the enclosing class, and how you can reference the outer class member
			when this happens.
			
		The classes include simple runners that can be executed as java programs.
