		Keywords:
			+ Anonymous Inner Classes

		AnonymousInnerClassTest1:
			This class includes a very simple example involving an anonymous inner class
			that is created in the definition of a field member class which happens to be
			an interface:
	
		Sequence:
			This class demonstrates how to implement an iterator-ish interface named
			Selector to iterate over a sequence of objects.
			In order to do that, the Sequence includes a method that returns
			an instance of the Selector interface and the implementations is done
			there.
		
		The classes include simple runners that can be executed as java program.
