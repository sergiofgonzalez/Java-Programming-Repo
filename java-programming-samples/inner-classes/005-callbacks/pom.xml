		TODO
		Keywords:
			+ Callback
			+ Closure

		Callbacks:
			This class demonstrates how to implement a callback to perform an action
			on an object (Callee) through an external object (Caller) that maintains
			a reference to the former object (Callee).
			In this case, a stupid Incrementable interface is defined. The Callee
			object implements this interface directly, but also defines a private 
			member inner class (Closure) that also implements this interface and a 
			public method that returns a reference to this closure.
			The Caller object maintains a reference to an Incrementable implementation
			that can be used to increment the external object when needed.
		
		The classes include simple runners that can be executed as java program.
