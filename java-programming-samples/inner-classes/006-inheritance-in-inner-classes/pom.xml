			shows how you're forced to provide a constructor in the subclass that
			calls the constructor of the outer class you're inheriting from.
		
		LoggerTest:
			Demonstrates the peculiarities of inheritance with inner classes in an 
			example that involves several implementations of Logger.
			
		The classes include simple runners that can be executed as java program.
