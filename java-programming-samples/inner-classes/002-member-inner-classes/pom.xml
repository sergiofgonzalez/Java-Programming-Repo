		Keywords:
			+ Member Inner Classes

		This project includes a couple of very simple examples involving static nested classes:
	
		MemberInnerClassTest1:
			Demonstrates how to instantiate a Member Inner Class.
			
		MemberInnerClassTest2:
			Demonstrates how you can hide your implementation using member inner classes.
			In particular, by declaring the inner class as private a client programmer
			will never have access to the implementation. 
			
		The classes include simple runners that can be executed as java programs.
