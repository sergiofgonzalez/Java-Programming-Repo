		This project includes very simple examples involving the new IO API.
			
		FileSystemAndPathsRunner:
			Demonstrates how to use some FileSystem and Path methods without creating
			files or directories.
		
		CreateFilesAndDirsRunner:
			Demonstrates how to create and delete files and directories.	
			
		ListDirContentsRunner:
			Demonstrates how to list the immediate contents of file, how to manually
			list recursively a directory, and how to do it with the new JDK7 API.
			
		CopyAndMoveFilesRunner:
			Demonstrates how to copy and move files.
		
		ReadAndWriteSmallFilesRunner:
			Demonstrates how to read and write small text files using Files.read() and
			Files.write().
			
		FileCompareRunner:
			Very simplistic file comparison tool that demonstrates how to read binary
			files.
			
		BinaryStreamCopyRunner:
			Very simplistic file copy program that demonstrate how to read binary files
			and how to write them.
		
		OutputStreamWriterTestRunner:
			Demonstrates how you can write unicode characters as Chinese Simplified
			GB2312 file. If you open the resulting file with an application capable
			of displaying Chinese GB2312 characters you will see the correct result.
			Note, how as the file is not written in UTF-8 the bytes written on the
			output file will be different from the ones you specified. However, in
			the utf-16 file you would get FE FE followed by the chars you wrote.
			
		PrintWriterTestRunner:
			Demonstrates how to use the PrintWriter wrapped in a BufferedWriter that
			even specifies the charset.
		
		InputStreamReaderTestRunner:
			Demonstrates how to read a text file with chinese characters using an 
			InputStreamReader.
			
		BufferedReaderTestRunner:
			Demonstrates how to use a buffered reader to read text files, one line at
			a time.
			
		PrintStreamTestRunner:
			Demonstrates how to redirect System.out to file by creating a PrintStream
			object.
		
		SeekableByteChannelTestRunner:
			Demonstrates how to use a ByteBuffer and a SeekableByteChannel to perform
			random file access operations.
		
		ObjectSerializationTestRunner:
			Demonstrates how to serialize a simple domain object and a string using
			an ObjectOutputStream and how to deserialize it using an ObjectInputStream.
