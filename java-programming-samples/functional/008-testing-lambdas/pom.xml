        PointTest:
            Several junit test cases including lambdas and function fields.
            
        FilterTest:
            Several junit test cases including functions that accept functions.
            
        DebuggingRunner:
            A runner than includes crafted errors to have a look at the stack traces.
            
        PeekRunner:
