		Keywords:

		This project includes very simple examples involving Threading.
		
		ThreadDemo:
			Demonstrates how to create a simple multithreaded application as a class
			that extends from Thread.
			
		ThreadDemo2:
			Demonstrates how to create a simple multithreaded application by creating
			a class that is instantiated from another class. The application is
			implemented as a Swing application with a single button that you can click
			to create a new thread.
			
		RunnableDemo:
			Demonstrates how to implement a Runnable and start its execution from the
			main.
			
		MultipleThreadsDemo:
			Demonstrates how to implement Swing application with a couple of threads
			that perform a count up and a count down in the background. Those threads
			are creates as nested classes within the main swing app.
			
		ThreadPriorityDemo:
			Demonstrates how to adjust the priority of a thread. A Swing application
			is created with a couple of textfields counters that are adjusted by
			threads created with different priorities.
			Note that in my machine, both counters run at the same rate although one
			of the counters is running with different priority.
