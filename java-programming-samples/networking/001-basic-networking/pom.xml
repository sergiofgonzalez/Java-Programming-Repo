		Keywords:

		This project includes very simple examples involving Java networking.
			
		UrlParsingDemo:
			Demonstrates how to parse a URL using the get methods of the URL class.
			
		ReadWebResourceUsingURLDemo:
			Demonstrates how to read a web resource using the openStream method of the
			URL class.
		
		ReadWebREsourceUsingURLConnectionDemo:
			Demonstrates how to read a web resource using URLConnection instead of URL.
			Also the response headers are read and displayed on the console.
			
		WriteWebResourceUsingURLConnectionDemo:
			Demonstrates how to write a request using URLConnection. 
			The code has not been tested.
			
		SocketServerDemo/SocketClientDemo:
			Demonstrates how to communicate using Socket/ServerSocket classes using
			a custom protocol.
			The SocketServerDemo establishes itself on port 1234 and waits for incoming
			connections. For each message received from the client, the server will 
			respond with an echo message including the original message and will also
			display the message on the console. If the client sends the 'bye' command
			the server will shutdown.
			The SocketClientDemo will send three messages to localhost:1234 and will
			print the responses received from the server on the screen.
